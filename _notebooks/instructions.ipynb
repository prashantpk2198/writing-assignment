To overcome this, make a tiny non-significant change to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` such as adding new-line at the end of file or changing the name of github action in line `1` of `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and push the new changes. This should solve the problem and github actions should be triggered normally on every push from now on. Doing this once is enough.\n",
